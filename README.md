# Overview

Workloads running on Kubernetes do not make assumptions about the underlying infrastructure. However,  it is still non-trivial to move them across different clusters. It is also non trivial to move them to another namespace within the same cluster scope such as to a different zone. KubeMove provides a set of tools and API to coordinate the orchestration and workflow of moving an application in production across cluster or namespace boundaries. 



# Architecture/Design proposal

The initial KEP (KubeMove Enhancement Proposal) is at [KEP-1](<https://github.com/kubemove/kubemove/blob/master/keps/0001-kep-kubemove-hld.md>)

Join the discussion through the issue [here](<https://github.com/kubemove/kubemove/issues/14>)



# Using Kubemove

- Install kubemove using helm - `helm install kubemove.io/kubemove`
- Annotate the application to be moved with `kubemove.io/kubemove.enable="true"`
- Use `MoveEngine` API with the required configuration to start the data movement or sync
- Wait for the movement or datasync to complete  and switch the application on the target cluster using `MoveSwitch` API

# CLI

**Example move commands:**

`kubectl km move init <app> <kubemove-template.yaml>`

`kubectl km status <movepair-cr>`

`kubectl km move switch <movepair>`



# Use cases

- Hybrid and multi-cloud deployments - Move applications on-prem to cloud or vice-versa or from cloud-cloud
- Onramp to Kubernetes - KubeMove can help migrate the data from legacy volumes onto Kubernetes
- Kubernetes and/or application upgrades - Applications may need to be moved back and forth while following blue green strategy

# Developer Guide

Kubemove uses `Makefile` based build process. This section will give you an overview on how to build and deploy Kubemove resources.

## Setup Environment

Setup your development environment by the following steps.

- Use your own docker account for the docker images:
```bash
export REGISTRY=<your docker username>
```
- For AWS ECR

```bash
export REGISTRY=<accountid>.dkr.ecr.<Region>.amazonaws.com
```
- Changes in build/push
  Replace this "sudo docker login "${REGISTRY}" -u "${DNAME}" -p "${DPASS}";" with
  aws ecr get-login-password --region <Region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "${REGISTRY}"

- Build a developer image with all dependencies:
```bash
make dev-image
```

## Code Generation

If you update any API or any gRPC protos, then generate respective codes by the following steps.

 - Generate gRPC codes:
 ```bash
make gen-grpc
 ```

- Generate CRDs and respective codes.
```bash
make gen-crds
```

- Update respective controllers
```bash
make gen-k8s
```

Alternatively, you can run the following command that will run all the previous code generation commands.

```bash
make gen
```

## Build the Binaries and Docker Images

If you update any codes, then re-build the project and the respective docker images.

- Run `gofmt`
```bash
make format
```

- Run linter
```bash
make lint
```

- Build binaries
```bash
make build
```

- Build docker images
```bash
make images
```

- Push docker images
```bash
make deploy-images
```

## Deploy Kubemove

At first, create two different clusters. Make sure `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is pointing to the right cluster config file.

- Specify the source cluster, and the destination cluster
```bash
export SRC_CONTEXT=<source cluster context>
export DST_CONTEXT=<destination cluster context>
```

- Register the Kubemove CRDs
```bash
make register_crds
```
- Create the RBAC resources
```bash
make create_rbac_resources
```

- Deploy MovePair controller
```bash
make deploy_mp_ctrl
```

- Deploy MoveEngine controller
```bash
make deploy_me_ctrl
```

- Deploy DataSync controller
```bash
make deploy_ds_ctrl
```

You can also install all the Kubemove resources by using the following command:
```bash
make deploy_kubemove
```

If you are using two local kind cluster, you can create a MovePair using the following command:
```bash
make create_local_mp
```

## Removing Kubemove

You can uninstall/remove all Kubemove resources created in the deploy section just by replacing
`deploy`,`create`, or `register` word of the respective command with `remove`. For example:
```bash
make remove_mp_ctrl
```

Alternatively, you can use the following command to remove all the Kubemove resources created in the clusters using
the following command,
```bash
make purge_kubemove
```
